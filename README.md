# cinnamon.js

A JavaScript client for the Cinnamon CMS

# Introduction

This is an experimental client for the [Cinnamon CMS](http://cinnamon-cms.com).

I want to write some advanced webclient features and also extend my JavaScript knowledge.

The goal is to have a client library

* which can be used for fat Cinnamon applications, for example editing complex Cinnamon object graphs in the browser (DITA, S1000D, XML);
* which exposes core Cinnamon object types to improve the existing webclient, for example a dynamic search builder;
* which contains a collection of tests for the XML server API.

# Project status

The project is in pre-alpha status. Currently, it can connect to a Cinnamon repository and fetch several object lists (Acls, FolderTypes, ObjectTypes) which are essential to building more complex classes.
